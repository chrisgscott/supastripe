# Authentication and Onboarding

This document outlines the authentication and onboarding processes in PayKit, including the integration between Supabase Auth and Stripe Connect.

## Authentication Flow

PayKit uses Supabase Authentication to manage user sessions and identity. The authentication flow is as follows:

### Sign Up Process
1. User visits the signup page
2. User provides their email and password
3. Supabase Auth creates a new user account
4. User receives email verification
5. Upon verification, user is redirected to the onboarding flow

### Sign In Process
1. User visits the login page
2. User enters their credentials
3. Supabase Auth validates the credentials
4. Upon successful authentication, user is redirected to their dashboard

### Session Management
- Sessions are managed by Supabase Auth
- JWT tokens are used for API authentication
- Session refresh is handled automatically
- Secure session storage in browser

## Onboarding Flow

The onboarding process connects a business's PayKit account with their Stripe account using Stripe Connect.

### Stripe Connect Integration

#### Step 1: Initial Setup
1. Business clicks "Connect with Stripe" button
2. System initiates Stripe Connect OAuth flow
3. Business is redirected to Stripe's onboarding form

#### Step 2: Stripe Account Creation/Connection
1. Business completes Stripe's onboarding form
2. Stripe validates business information
3. Upon approval, Stripe generates Connect credentials

#### Step 3: Account Synchronization
1. PayKit receives Stripe Connect webhook
2. System syncs business details from Stripe:
   - Business name
   - Business type
   - Contact information
   - Banking details
3. Information is stored in Supabase database

### Data Synchronization

The following data is synchronized between Stripe and PayKit:

#### Business Details
- Legal business name
- Business type
- Address information
- Contact details

#### Financial Information
- Bank account details
- Payout schedule
- Account status

#### Compliance Information
- Verification status
- Required documentation status
- Capability status

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Implementation
- Supabase Auth is configured with email/password authentication
- JWT tokens are used for API authentication
- Session management is handled by Supabase client

### Stripe Connect Implementation
- OAuth integration with Stripe Connect
- Webhook handling for account updates
- Automatic syncing of business details

### Security Considerations
- All sensitive data is stored in Stripe
- Only non-sensitive business details are stored in Supabase
- Secure webhook validation
- OAuth state validation

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors
- Invalid credentials
- Email verification failures
- Session expiration
- Rate limiting

### Stripe Connect Errors
- Failed account creation
- Incomplete onboarding
- Webhook failures
- Sync failures

## Testing

### Authentication Testing
- Test account creation
- Test login flows
- Test session management
- Test error scenarios

### Stripe Connect Testing
- Test account connection
- Test webhook handling
- Test data synchronization
- Test error scenarios
